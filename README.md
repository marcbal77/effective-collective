**Effective Collective** is a user-friendly, Web3 solution, for _voicing and voting_ within organizations and governments. Our project is paving a secure path for decentralized democracy by removing the need for antiquated voting systems and representatives whose interests are aligned with deep pockets, instead of the real-time desires of their constituents. Put the power of the voice and the vote in YOUR pocket.

The MVP will be deployed on the **Oasis Sapphire** blockchain and facilitate voting for small organizations, with first adopters being decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Future iterations of Effective Collective will facilitate _community discourse_, as well as scaling to _local, state, provincial, and federal governments_.

**BOUNTIES**

- [**Oasis Protocol**](https://ethdenver2024.devfolio.co/prizes?partner=Oasis+Protocol)
  - Launch MVP on Testnet or Mainet. Deploy smart-contracts on Oasis Sapphire that use Sapphire specific features as the basis for the project's unique value proposition.

**TECH STACK & FEATURES**

- [**Oasis Sapphire**](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime) blockchain. Fully privacy enabled and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible. Allows for smart contracts with private data (i.e. voting data). End-to-end encryption between the smart contract, dApp, and user. Finality inherent in blockchains.
- [**Oasis privacy layer**](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime) as a message and token bridge that allow any EVM compatible smart contracts on other networks to pass messages and communicate with the Sapphire chain.
- [**Scaffold-ETH**](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) on EVM compatible blockchains. Allows devs to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts. Uses NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

**UX/UI FEATURES**

**Deployed**

**Simplified user interface** and experience for scaling to users who are not savvy in Web3 systems. Front end of this is built to demonstrate ease of use.

**Future Iterations**

1. **Customizable dashboard**.
2. Ability to **sort and filter proposals** that are up for vote by time when the vote is due, budget size, and/or general category (i.e. environment, taxes, etc.).
3. **Comprehensive proposal page** allows for voter research, voicing and endorsing opinions, as well as casting a vote on that proposal.
4. Discourse box section within each proposal allows users to **voice pros/cons to the community**. This feature also includes the ability to **up-vote opinions that users agree most with**, democratically filtering the most widely-held opinions to the top.
5. Users can swipe left to remove proposals or discourse boxes from their interface.
6. **Ranked choice voting** for proposals that offer more than one option to vote on (i.e. candidate voting).
7. **Quadratic "Boost" voting**. Users receive a balance of Boost votes to hyper-endorse proposals they feel most passionate about. Boost vote allocation depends on how many proposals a user is currently qualified to vote on.
8. Corresponding Boost votes expire once a proposal's voting outcome is written to the blockchain.
9. **NFT badges** are generated to 1) **confirm a user has voting rights** within a given DAO, city, province, state, etc. 2) **confirm the user's vote** has been recorded on the ledger.
10. Users can collect their voting badges for each organization, or proposal.

Please note: Many features are marked for the future because all four members of our team were committed to Camp BUIDL and had a limited time for the group project.

Thank you for helping us build a more private, secure, and intelligent system that supports modern democracy :)
